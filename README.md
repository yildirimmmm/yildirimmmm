- Account-based login system with registration support  
- Option to bind licenses or user accounts to hardware (via HWID locking)

🛠️ **Built With:**
- Backend: **PHP**
- Client Libraries: Available for **C#** and **PHP**

🌐 The platform includes:
- A desktop-ready client library
- A PHP SDK for web-based applications
